pyCM - a collection of visualization and data processing tools written in Python 2.7 for performing the contour method.

Uses pyVTK for visualisation, SciPy and NumPy. Currently only tested on Windows 7.

A number of these tools have been developed based on MATLAB code written by Greg Johnson, Chris Gill, Matt Fox, Philip Frankel and Yuan-Sheng Xiong (and probably others) between 2004-2013.
